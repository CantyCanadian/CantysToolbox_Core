# CantysToolbox_Core
Core features of the toolbox. Mandatory for all other packages to work, but can be used as-is. Contains basic features like class parents, attributes and other code-specific utility stuff.

Important Notes :
- .NET 4.0 required. If you can't use 4.0, you can delete FileBrowserUtil to remove the dependency.

Current To-Do List :
- Create a more thorough way to credit the original creator of some of the features.
- Properly document the current features.
- Create a proper test scene and manually test every features, both for debugging purposes and gather my own material for the wiki.
